    <h1>features of html5</h1>
    <main>
        <ol><li>Semantics: HTML5 introduced a set of new elements that provide better semantic structure to web pages. These include header, nav, section, article, aside, footer, and more. With these elements, developers can create more meaningful and well-structured content.</li>
        <li>Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. The &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements allow embedding multimedia content directly into web pages, making it easier to deliver and control audio and video content.</li>
        <li>Canvas: The &lt;canvas&gt; element introduced in HTML5 provides a 2D drawing API, allowing developers to draw graphics, animations, charts, and visualizations directly within the web browser using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Geolocation: HTML5 added support for retrieving the user's geographical location through the Geolocation API. This enables developers to create location-aware web applications and services.</li>
        <li>Offline Web Applications: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache API, which allows web applications to work offline by caching the necessary files on the user's device. This enables users to continue using web applications even when they are not connected to the internet.</li>
        <li>Web Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which provide a way to store data locally on the user's device. This enables web applications to store and retrieve data without relying on cookies or making server requests.</li></ol>
